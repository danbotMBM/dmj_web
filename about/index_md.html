<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi there, thanks for visiting my site.
This site catalogs the things that I've been doing and learning about these days.
Most of the content of this site revolve around my enjoyment of computers, programming, and technology.
Also, to make the site nice to look at, I've shared some photos I've taken as a <em>very amateur</em> photographer.</p>
<h2>Why make this site?</h2>
<p>Computer technology spans so many different fields and disciplines.
I can get caught up in <em>maybe</em> wanting to learn about this or that without really doing anything.
Youtube videos about interesting technology or engineering often scratch my itch for knowledge without turning into skills or understanding.
This site serves as a way to motivate me to explore a new skill, tool, or technology; and get my hands dirty trying to make it work.</p>
<p>I was really inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlFkxfkICO8&amp;list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLSHTbG4lQadRRtjzjARK69h">video series</a> by the creator of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Masahiro Sakurai.
In this series Sakurai shares some lessons on 'work ethic'.
He highlights the power of <a href="https://youtu.be/IN-Uh2VfL8c?si=Av3g61ZvVqoye5yh"><em>motivation</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ff7HadWHTJo?si=NDm8zBv1tACM6Tf1"><em>output</em></a> when trying to achieve anything.
Sakurai describes how he kept up with a consistent output schedule of articles in a gaming magazine.
He credits this consistency with his willingness to just put something out that he thought was good without overthinking it.
Often, I find that my expectations for perfection can prevent me from making progress to a personal goal.
Of course, doing something <em>perfect</em> is great.
But when balancing a full time job, family, and friends, there is only so much you can do.
Doing something <em>good</em> is way better than doing <em>nothing at all</em>.
As a renowned game developer and producer, Mr. Sakurai has clearly learned a lot about how to be excellent and gather expertise.
He inspires me to find understanding knowledge by getting to work and producing something I can point to that proves that I've learned something I would not have known before, without getting bogged down in being exceptional.</p>
<p>Making this site allows me to catalog and share my explorations into all these different applications of computer technology, motivating me to keep growing myself through joyful curiosity.</p>
